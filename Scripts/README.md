This folder contains the scripts to be used in Adobe Illustrator

01 Empty Floor Plan

Purpose: Given the original empty floor plan, the user is to draw the boundaries in order to mark out areas where the capstone booths can be allocated to. The script will then loop through all the boundaries and assign the capstone groups to the boundaries accordingly.
  
    Before running the script, please do the following:
      1. Create a new layer in the Illustrator File
      2. Draw the respective boundaries on the new layer
      3. Select all the boundaries
      4. Run the script
