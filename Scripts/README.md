This folder contains the scripts to be used in Adobe Illustrator

01 Empty Floor Plan

Purpose: Given the original empty floor plan, the user is to draw the boundaries in order to mark out areas where the capstone booths can be allocated to. The script will then loop through all the boundaries and assign the capstone groups to the boundaries accordingly.
  
    Before running the script, please do the following:
   1. Create a brand new layer in the Illustrator file
   2. Draw all the boundaries on the new layer
   3. Select all the boundaries to be considered
   4. Open the script and manually change the pathname to the said illustrator file
   5. Run the script to get the first output from the algorithm
