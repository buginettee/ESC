This is the Github Repository for project 2 (Capstone Allocation)

Approach taken towards the project is two-pronged: An online form parser, and a script for Adobe Illustrator

How it works (Online form parser):


How it works (Script for Illustrator):
Several scripts in a folder will be provided alongside an instructional README.md. Follow all the instructions in the README and save files into the instructed folders to ensure a smooth running of the script.

These scripts are specifically designed to take in drawn boundaries on Adobe Illustrator and generate an allocation for all the capstone groups. The user will then be able to make amendments directly in Illustrator. Once completed, the allocation can be selectively saved for some groups while rerunning the algorithm on others.
